# AKB Aella

The Aella is a 75% “seamless/screwless” board that adopts a beautiful and unique side profile with clean, smooth curves and a compact design with a staggered F-row. In my opinion this is the optimal 75% layout aesthetically, while not compromising on function. I decided to go with a ‘screwless’ design to focus all attention on the sweeping curves of the side profile, as that is the real star of the show here.

It also has a pretty name so it has that going for it too.
